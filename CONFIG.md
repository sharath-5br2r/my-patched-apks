# Config

Adding another revanced app is as easy as this:
```toml
[Some-App]
apkmirror-dlurl = "https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/inc/app"
# or uptodown-dlurl = "https://app.en.uptodown.com/android"
```

> [!WARNING]
> When a patch name itself contains a single quote, double it inside the string (e.g. 'Hide ''Get Music Premium''').

## More about other options:

There exists an example below with all defaults shown and all the keys explicitly set.  
**All keys are optional** (except download urls) and are assigned to their default values if not set explicitly.

## Multiple Patch Sources

You can pass multiple patch bundles to the CLI by specifying `patches-source` as a quoted list (same format as `excluded-patches`).
When using multiple sources, the CLI merges the patch bundles. However, please see the **Current Limitations** below regarding `included-patches` and `excluded-patches`.

```toml
# single-line format
patches-source = "'MorpheApp/morphe-patches' 'other/patches'"

# multiline format
patches-source = """\
  'MorpheApp/morphe-patches' \
  'other/patches' \
  """

# If all sources are on the same host, a single string applies to all:
patches-source-host = "github"

# If sources span different hosts, provide one value per source in order:
patches-source-host = "'github' 'gitlab'"

# Same rule applies to patches-version:
patches-version = "latest"                        # applies to all sources
patches-version = "'latest' 'v1.2.3'"             # per-source versions
```

> [!WARNING]
> **Current Limitations**: 
> Due to how the underlying CLIs handle arguments, `included-patches` and `excluded-patches` currently only apply to the **last** patch bundle in your `patches-source` list. 
> Per-bundle selective inclusion/exclusion (e.g. including one patch from the first bundle, and excluding another from the second) is not currently supported in this config format. If you use multiple sources, it is recommended to apply all patches from the preceding bundles.

## Xposed Modules (NPatch / LSPatch)

You can natively inject Xposed modules into an app using `7723mod/NPatch` or `LSPatch` directly from your config. Simply set the `cli-source` to the NPatch repository and the `patches-source` to the Xposed module repository.

```toml
[Discord]
cli-source = "7723mod/NPatch"                            # Use NPatch as the CLI
cli-version = "latest"
patches-source = "revenge-mod/revenge-xposed"            # Provide the Xposed module as the patches bundle
patches-version = "latest"
version = "auto"                                         # 'auto' safely falls back to 'latest' since modules don't list supported versions
arch = "auto"
github-dlurl = "https://github.com/discord/releases/..." # Or apkmirror, etc.
```

When the script detects `npatch` or `lspatch` in the CLI source, it will automatically bypass ReVanced CLI arguments and execute the correct injection command. You can also pass extra options to NPatch using `patcher-args = "-l 2"`.

## Modular Configuration Directory

All configurations are now stored in the `.github/configs/patches/` directory for better maintainability.

- `config.toml`: Contains the global settings and base configurations.
- `*.stable.toml`: Configurations specifically merged into the `stable` build.
- `*.dev.toml`: Configurations specifically merged into the `dev` (pre-release) build.

Any configuration file in `.github/configs/patches/` that does **not** contain `stable` or `dev` in its filename is automatically included in **both** builds.

To add a new app, simply create or update a `.toml` file in `.github/configs/patches/`.

## Automatic App Version Checking

The CI workflow automatically detects when a new version of an app is released on APKMirror, Uptodown, or Archive.org.

### How it Works
1. **Version Fetching**: During the CI run, it reads all enabled apps from the `.github/configs/patches/*.toml` configurations and queries the URLs (`uptodown-dlurl`, `apkmirror-dlurl`, etc.).
2. **Comparison**: It checks the newly fetched versions against the currently stored versions in `.github/configs/app_versions.json`.
3. **Triggering**: If a new version is detected, the app is added to a temporary `active_apps.json` list, and the CI is triggered to build it.
### Tracking File
App versions are permanently tracked and committed to `.github/configs/app_versions.json`.
You can manually update this file if you need to force a specific version state, but the CI will automatically manage it during scheduled runs.

**Selective Checking:** If you only want the CI to check specific apps (instead of all enabled apps in your config), you can add `"_check_only_listed": true` to the top level of `app_versions.json`. When this is true, the script will only check for updates for the apps that already exist as keys in the file, saving time and resources.
